Submit a zip archive of your project including screenshots, clearly illustrating the added/improved functionality of your application:
    –UI design that goes beyond the prototypes given in class
    –Applications should at the very least implement the viewing functionality for at least 3 distinct resources/entities with structures similar to that of the FHIR standard 
        (e.g., practitioner, patient, order, result, etc.)
    –The resources/entities should be functionally and logically related through composition/referencing using either MongoDB join queries or application logic
        e.g., since a Patient’s doctor is a Practitioner, there should be a logical link from a Patient record to one of more practitioners in the Employee collection
        e.g., Since a Practitioner writes Orders, etc., an order record in the order collection should have a field that logically links the authoring practitioner in the Employee collection

Application must make use of existing data standards to represent patient data
    –Must use LOINC codes for lab tests identifiers
    –Must use ICD10 codes for problems, diagnoses identifiers
    –Must use DPD identifiers (ATC, DIN) for drug data identifiers

Demonstrates login and session control functionality for practitioners
    –e.g., storing username/id and password and last viewed patient in the employee record

At least 3 pdf/screenshots of reports from collections–Ideally reports will include images
    –Example reports/printouts:
        Patients (patients.pdf) 
            -wristband
        Practitioners (practitioners.pdf) 
            –badge
        Orders (orders.pdf) 
            –medication order
            –Drug labels (drugs.pdf)
            –Test labels (test.pdf)
        Results (results.pdf) 
            –results

Reports must contain barcode technologies (linear, 2D etc.)

Barcode automation functionality:
    –Scanning patient bracelet/RFID selects the patient and display patient data 
    –eMAR/BCMA (barcode medication administration)

Demonstrates other improvements: e.g., password change functionality, RFID login, etc
